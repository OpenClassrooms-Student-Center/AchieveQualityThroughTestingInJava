# Test Your Own Calculator
## p2-c3-sc1

This branch contains a solution which multiplies two doubles and avoids floating point arithmetic errors.

Have a go at:
* Implementing division of two Doubles using a test case of 20.2 / 102
* Use the BigDecimal library and call the `bigDecimal.divide(BigDecimal dividedBy);` method.
* Add your test case to CalculatorTest and see if you can make it work. First try it without
  BigDecimal and then with.
* If you're feeling up to the challenge see if you can find other ways to break the code.

Have fun!
