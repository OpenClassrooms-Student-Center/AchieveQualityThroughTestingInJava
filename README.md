# Test Your Own Calculator
## P3-C5: Page Object
This repository contains the screencasts for the Test Your Own 
Java Application course.

Each screencast will have a branch which is referred to in the course notes.

## A Fun Challenge
1. See if you can add a test to see if the title is "Open Calculator".
1. You want to use By.id("title") to get back WebElement. 
1. You can then call getText() on it to retrieve the title of the page
1. This can be used in your assertion. 
1. Put those selectors in the Calculator PageObject.
1. Put the getTitle() method into your PageObject!

## Tips
Look at how we get the solution back in the existing test.
Getting the title will be similar, but without having to wait!
