# Test Your Own Calculator
## P2 Activity : Implementing Subtraction

You should be on the p2-activity branch

A student has reported that the calculator does not allow you to subract two numbers.

You must:
* Add test cases for subtraction to the CalculatorTest and Calculator classes using Red-Green-Refactor 
 * Ensure that you test a variety of situations.
* Add test cases to CalculatorServiceTest and implement the required additions to support subtraction.
 * Note that you will have to provide support for this in the Solver interface.
 * You should aim to mock your Calculator instance when writing CalcualtorService tests.
 * This should be very similar for what we've done for multiplication, division and addition. Try to come up with even better test scenarios!
